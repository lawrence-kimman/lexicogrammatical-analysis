# lexicogrammatical_analysis
 is about doing a systemic functional lexicogrammatical analysis of text. The R program reads the source texts from files and automatically analyses them with three metafunctions. The program starts with tokenisation and vectorisation from lower rank in word level. Afterwards, it ascends to higher rank in clause level.
